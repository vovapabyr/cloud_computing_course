# Homeworks

The course has several homeworks that gradually build a single project composed of several cloud services:
- Event Stream
- Object Store
- Database
- Function as a Service to glue everything together.

Additionally, we will evaluate project security, financial sustainability, observability, and test data restoration process.

## Homework requirements

- Each student maintains a git repository with completed tasks (code, docs, images)
- You can pick any cloud platform of your choice
